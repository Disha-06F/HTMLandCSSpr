        Dear Mirror of my mind,
        you are right. All about in this duniya is fake. I truly believe that.
        Yeah it is wrong that i  attached with someone. but trust me I didn't want it.
        but somehow it happened. when, where i really don't know.
        but i decided i will come out all of these fakeness.
        Today is the day.
